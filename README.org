#+TITLE: Centered Cursor Mode

This package provides ~centered-cursor-mode~ which keeps the point on the middle line of the screen, unless when it requires window to scroll past the beginning of buffer.

* Configuration

Use following block of code to activate mode globally:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-centered-cursor-mode)
#+end_src

Make sure to toggle the mode (off) for buffers where you don't wish automatic re-centering to occur: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'comint-mode-hook #'centered-cursor-disable)
#+end_src
